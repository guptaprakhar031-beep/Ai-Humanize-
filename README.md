ðŸ¤– What is AI Humanize?
AI Humanize is a powerful tool designed to transform machine-generated text into content that reads and feels as if it were written by a human. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) models, our application identifies and modifies patterns commonly found in AI-generated output, such as repetitive phrasing, overly formal language, and a lack of conversational flow.
The goal is to help users bypass AI detection, improve readability, and create engaging, authentic content for a variety of purposes, including essays, articles, social media posts, and marketing copy.
âœ¨ Features

Adjustable Humanization: Offers options to customize the degree of "humanization," from subtle tweaks to a complete stylistic overhaul.
Simple Interface: A clean and intuitive user interface makes it easy to paste text, adjust settings, and get instant results.
AI Detection Score: Provides an estimated score to show how well the humanized text might evade AI detection.
